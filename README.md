Hello, everyone!

I’m currently working on a game engine called Wrath Engine using Raylib and C++. The goal is to recreate the mechanics and spirit of old-school FPS games (Doom, Wolfenstein, etc.) with modern tools. While the engine is still in its early stages, I wanted to share my plans and gather feedback from the community.

🛠️ Planned Features
-Tile-Based Level Editor: Design maps easily with a tile-based approach.
-3D Preview: View your designs in 3D to refine and test them.
-Textures for Tile Editor Objects: Add detailed textures to objects in the tile editor.
-2D Sprite and 3D Model Adder: Incorporate sprites and models into your levels seamlessly.
-GUI Implementations: Improve user experience with an intuitive interface.
-Entity-Component System (ECS): Manage dynamic objects like characters and environment elements.
-Lua Programming Language Support: Create characters, AI, and other gameplay elements using Lua.
-Launcher for Projects: Easily create new projects and manage existing ones.

🎯 My Goal
The goal of Wrath Engine is to provide a simple yet flexible tool for retro FPS creators. I envision it as a platform that evolves with the help of the community and becomes a go-to choice for retro game enthusiasts.

Currently, I’m working on the tile-based level editor, but it’s still under development.

🤝 I’d Love Your Feedback!
What other features do you think would make this engine more useful? Feel free to share your thoughts, suggestions, or questions—I’d love to hear from you!

Thank you all, and I’ll keep updating this post with progress. 🚀
